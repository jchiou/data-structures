## Stack
* [complete] Implement a stack class in the pseudoclassical style.
  * Use an array for storage, and delegate to its methods
  * The stack should only have `.add`, `.remove`, and `._storage`, with no other properties or methods (you can test this by calling Object.keys() on your stack instance).
